"""Guards for CODE_WALKTHROUGH.md — the contributor walkthrough (Issue #10).

The walkthrough's whole value is that its `file:line` pointers are real and its
named symbols exist (the issue's hard constraint: "no invented APIs"). Line numbers
drift as code changes, so this test does not pin exact lines; it checks the weaker,
durable invariants that catch the real failure modes — a renamed/moved file, a typo'd
path, a line number past end-of-file, or a symbol the prose leans on that no longer
exists. The symbol names are the stable anchor; a drifted line is a convenience to fix.

Deterministic and offline: it only reads files already in the repo.

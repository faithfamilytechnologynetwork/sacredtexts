"""Regression guard for the committed English `first-run-2026-10-11` evidence.

**Scoring invariance (always runs):** re-scoring the committed `answers.jsonl` to a scratch
path reproduces the committed `scores.jsonl` byte-for-byte — proof that scoring changes did not
move Latin scoring over ~400 real answers. Writes only to a tmp path; never touches the
committed evidence.

The *generation*-invariance guard that used to live here (regenerate the question set from the
manifest and match the committed digest) was **retired in Spec 26**: it can no longer hold. The
committed first-run set is 100 `retrieve_quote`-only questions under the pre-Spec-26 generator;
Spec 26 both changed the corpus (Phase 1 removed the two `KJV (LDS 2013 edition)` targets) and
reshaped the generator (four templates, per-text quota, no `per_task`/`quotas`), so regenerating
from the committed inputs yields a *different* set and a different digest — a digest mismatch, by
design. The new generation-invariance anchor is the fresh Spec-26 run
(`runs/archive/original-2026-10-21/`), digest-pinned in `test_original_run_regression.py`
(`test_regenerating_original_run_reproduces_digest`). The re-score half below is unaffected and
stays.

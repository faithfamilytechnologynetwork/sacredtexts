"""The source catalogue: ``texts/raw/**/source.yaml`` as a *targets* manifest.

The real ``texts/raw`` tree is grouped **one directory per tradition**, each
holding many works, versions, and source shapes (Protestant = KJV/ASV/WEB; Sunni
= Quran + six hadith collections; LDS = five works; Talmud = dozens of tractate
shards; Roman Catholic = encyclicals + the restricted NABRE). A single flat
record cannot describe that, so each tradition directory carries one committed
``source.yaml`` with a ``targets:`` list; every target is one
``(work, version, language)`` unit:

    source_url: <optional provenance URL for the whole directory>
    notes: <optional free text>
    targets:
      - payload: "kjv.json"          # glob, relative to this source.yaml
        converter: bible_flat        # key into convert.CONVERTERS (bodies land in later phases)
        work: "The Bible"
        version: "KJV"
        language: en
        document_type: scripture
        tradition: ["Protestant Christian"]   # a bare string is accepted too
        license: public-domain                 # public-domain | open | restricted
        license_detail: "KJV — public domain"  # optional: the real upstream string, verbatim
        requested_as: ["the King James Version", "the KJV", "the King James Bible"]  # names used (>=1)
        canonical_language: en                 # the language this text is canonically in

``requested_as`` is the non-empty list of names a person would use for this edition; ``generate``
renders ``<edition>`` as a seeded uniform choice from it. ``canonical_language`` is the language this
text is canonically in (its authoritative wording — ``en`` for the KJV, not only a composition
language); a text is in the question pool only when ``language == canonical_language``.
Both are catalogue facts, not ``Document`` facts, and reach ``generate`` through
``metadata_for_standardized_path`` — recovered from the document's path like ``license``, since a
standardized ``Document`` carries neither and some converters (``encyclicals``) re-stamp
``work``/``version`` per document, so a ``(work, version, language)`` key cannot resolve them.
``text_metadata`` is a separate, *nominal* catalogue-wide view (keyed on each target's own tuple) that
exists to fail-fast on a cross-source metadata conflict — not the per-document resolution channel.

``license`` is the three-value gate. ``restricted`` targets (copyrighted
translations whose payloads are git-ignored and local-only) are excluded from
``convert``/``generate`` unless ``--include-restricted`` is passed; ``validate``
is unaffected by license.

**Standardized-path convention.** A target's converted output lives under
``texts/standardized/<source-id>/<target-slug>/`` mirroring
``texts/raw/<source-id>``. That lets ``generate`` recover a standardized
document's ``license`` *and* its text metadata (``requested_as`` /
``canonical_language``) from its path alone — the interchange ``Document`` format
stays unchanged (it carries neither).

Loading is fail-fast: a malformed target or unknown ``license`` raises
``CatalogueError`` naming the file and the offending target.

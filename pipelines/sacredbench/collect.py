"""Collection: fan every question out to every configured model.

Discipline ported from the multibench judging workflow:

- **Resumable**: answers append to ``answers.jsonl``; cells already answered
  (question_id, model_id) are skipped on re-run, so a crashed or partial run
  continues instead of re-paying.
- **Concurrency-bounded parallel** over provider calls (``concurrency`` in the
  run config); ``concurrency: 1`` is strictly serial.
- **Failed cells stay pending** and make the run exit non-zero — nothing is
  silently dropped, a re-run retries exactly the missing cells.

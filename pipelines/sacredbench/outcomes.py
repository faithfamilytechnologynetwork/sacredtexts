"""Outcome classification (Spec 15, decision #2): refusal is an OUTCOME, not a grader.

Every answered cell gets ``outcome`` ∈ {``correct``, ``incorrect``, ``refused``}. A **refusal** is
detected here, in the outcome layer, and **short-circuits the headline verdict** — a cell the model
declined to answer is neither right nor wrong, so it is excluded from accuracy (``accuracy =
correct/(correct+incorrect)``) and surfaced as ``coverage`` / ``refused_rate`` instead. Graders
(``graders.py``) only ever decide correct-vs-incorrect for the cells that were actually answered.

Refusal rule (deterministic, pre-registered against the committed runs' ``answers.jsonl`` — see
``tests/test_contains_reference_rebaseline.py`` for the frozen (model_id, question_id) set and the
per-model counts this matcher must reproduce):

    a cell is ``refused`` iff a **decline cue appears in the leading segment of the answer**
    (the first ``LEADING_WINDOW`` normalized characters) **AND** the expected reference is **not**
    delivered. The cue list is English. A decline in Greek, Hebrew, or Arabic that does not use
    one of these phrases is not classified as refused, so refusal rates are not comparable across
    scripts.

Both halves matter:

- *decline cue* — a conservative set of first-person inability / non-delivery / refusal markers
  (``DECLINE_CUES``). They are matched against the normalized answer, so case and punctuation
  (including the apostrophe in ``can't``) fold automatically.
- *leading segment* — the cue must OPEN the answer, not trail it. An answer that delivers the verse
  and then appends a caveat ("…verse… (I couldn't retrieve the source to verify)") is an ANSWER with
  a disclaimer, not a refusal; its cue sits past the delivered text, outside the leading window. In
  the committed runs 262/266 declines open at character 0; the window only has to clear the longest
  genuine preamble ("I'm sorry, but I am unable…", "Let me try to get the segment. I couldn't…").
- *reference not delivered* — a decline-prefixed answer that still contains the reference
  (word-bounded) IS a correct retrieval ("I can't be certain, but it's: <verse>"), so the containment
  half keeps it out of the refused set. For ``cite_passage`` a leading decline alone is the refusal,
  gated on ``not correct`` so a decline-prefixed but delivered citation stays an answer.
  ``verify_source`` is **not** classified here (Spec 26): its "answer" is the verdict itself, so its
  refusal is ``parsed is None`` (no leading Yes/No committed), decided in ``score._with_outcome`` — a
  committed leading verdict is graded even with a trailing disclaimer, and a negation-evasion with no
  leading verdict is refused, not scored correct.

This module is deliberately thin: the primitives (``normalize``, ``bounded_contains``, ``parse_yes_no``)
live in ``score.py`` and are imported lazily so there is no import cycle (``score`` imports this inside
``score_answer``).

"""Copyright audit for committed artifacts.

The copyright gate (Spec 1) says no text derived from a ``restricted`` source
(NABRE, the TLG Greek Orthodox extracts) may be committed to this public repo.
This audit enforces it mechanically rather than by a pre-commit promise: it reads a
set of committed artifacts (standardized documents and the run evidence —
``questions.jsonl`` / ``answers.jsonl``), recovers each one's source
``(work, version, language)``, and fails if any maps to a ``restricted`` catalogue
target. Since restricted payloads are never committed, origin is the enforceable
proxy for "contains restricted text": an artifact derived from a restricted source
is exactly what must not be here.

The scanned set is ``.json`` / ``.jsonl`` / ``.md`` (``_AUDITED_SUFFIXES``): the ``.md``
inclusion puts the human-readable FAccT card (Spec 32 ``facct.md``) inside the gate. The
origin layer applies only to the structured ``.json`` / ``.jsonl`` documents; a ``.md`` card
has no source dict, so it gets the content (restricted-text fingerprint) layer only.

Run it over the evidence before committing, and in the test gate:

    uv --project pipelines run python -m sacredbench audit runs/<id> texts/standardized
